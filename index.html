            Whale Watching,reykjavik
  No matter when you plan to travel, whale watching 
  happens year-round, although summer is the most popular 
  time to see these gentle giants. During the warmer months, 
  trips run day and night, including whale watching in the midnight sun. 
  Tour operators say there's an 80-95 percent chance of seeing these
  magnificent creatures, depending on the time of year. 
  Best of all, surfacing often happens right near the boats, so you 
  may as well enjoy a ringside seat for one of nature's most 
  awe-inspiring spectacles.

  of geothermal spas is a must-see tourist attraction.
  Here, you'll find natural bathing in pale blue water in

  since it first became a hit with locals in 1976. 
  The water from the underground hot springs reaches 37-39 degrees 
  Celsius and is said to be highly beneficial for both health and skin.

                Aurora Borealis,
  The northern Lights, or Aurora Borealis, are among the most popular 
  tourist attractions in Iceland. 
  Auroras are linked to solar wind, a flow of ions radiating from the sun. 
  These particles become ensnared in the earth's magnetic field and 
  collide with atmospheric molecules, causing bursts of energy, which 
  appear as large circles around the poles. 
  This spectacular natural light show is best admired in remote places 
  and is particularly impressive at times of increased solar activity.
